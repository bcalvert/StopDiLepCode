In order to compile the skimming macro, after setting your CMSSW environment (command 'cmsenv' within a SCRAM based CMSSW release area)
you should only have to do the command 'make' in the directory containing the skimming macro NewOviStopPlotSkimmer.C

Once the code has compiled, you then submit some condor jobs to process the skimming by using the script OviedoNTupleSkimmer.sh
i.e.
./OviedoNTupleSkimmer.sh

Note that, as of 7/17/13, it will save the output skim files to the same location they were loaded in from, so currently, 
/data/users/bcalvert/new_oviedo_ntuples_5_14_13
