First things first, with the current state of the Oviedo nTuples you will have to skim them first. This is accomplished by the code in the SkimmingMacro directory (see README file in that directory)

nominally, you should be able to do the following
> make
and the code will compile; I have been running into issues with this super recently, as it complains about double definition of two particular functions, dPhi and deltaR, even though the code compiles just fine in its original directory that I copied it from

once the code has compiled you run it with the following command

./NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst
additional command line inputs are described in the .C file, but the most important two are
"-i": input file name. Should be immediately followed by said name, but with no .root appendage
"-w": which kind of nTuple -- i.e. Oviedo or DESY.
so, to run on an Oviedo nTuple called "Tree_TTJetsFullHadrMG_6_Oviedo_SkimOutput.root" you would do
./NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst -i Tree_TTJetsFullHadrMG_6_Oviedo_SkimOutput -w 0
so, to run on a DESY nTuple called "ttbar.root" you would do
./NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst -i ttbar -w 1
More commonly, you'll probably want to run with systematics getting booked (put "doBookSyst" as a command line input) and the proper PURW for MC (add in "doPURW doHackPURW")
Example:
./NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst -i Tree_TTJetsFullHadrMG_6_Oviedo_SkimOutput -w 0 doPURW doHackPURW doBookSyst
or
./NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst -i ttbar -w 1 doPURW doHackPURW doBookSyst

Note, I have also included four shell scripts to submit condor jobs to run on the relevant Oviedo or DESY nTuples
OviMCPlotMaker.sh
OviDataPlotMaker.sh
DESYMCPlotMaker.sh
DESYDataPlotMaker.sh
These scripts will read the list nTuples from the appropriate directory (currently,
/data/users/tkolberg/new_oviedo_ntuples_5_14_13 for Oviedo
/data/users/tkolberg/new_top for DESY
)
and run the ./NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst with appropriate settings, included saving output to the directory specified in outputSavePath.txt

Note, that if you want to run in parallel on the files
