# we have just one channel, in which we observe BackNum events -- note this is just a "hack" for now to aid in the calculation of expected limits, as, if I remember correctly, the Asymptotic method automatically, barring other input, chooses the observed limit as the starting point for iterating from there.

# now we list the expected events for signal and all backgrounds in that bin
# the second 'process' line must have a positive number for backgrounds, and 0 for signal
# then we list the independent sources of uncertainties, and give their effect (syst. error)
