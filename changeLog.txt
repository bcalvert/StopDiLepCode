StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h	
Added in generator level top reweighting for the systematic
Added in Stop XSection systematic
Added in Histogram for "MT2ll passes cut" where cut is 80-120 GeV in 10 GeV steps, so 5 histograms in total
Added in 1D histogram for Delta Phi between Z and MET
Added in .do(X,Y,Z)Syst for the 2D and 3D histograms (still need some work on how to book the histograms in a correct fashion)

StopPlotHaddInfo.h
Added in some additional Oviedo samples' information, including the ability to hadd "exclusive" samples (TTBar individualized by decay mode and DY + # of jets) as opposed to "inclusive" samples
Fixed minor bug with TTBar samples for Oviedo in hadding

StopPlotSetup.h
Fixed the legend for Statistical and Systematic Uncertainties

PlotMaker scripts
Added in ability to do local condor queue

NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C
Added in appropriate things to match the changes to StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h
Added in booking of 2D and 3D histograms w/ systematics
Added in generator top and antitop pT histograms when running on TTBar samples that have them
Added in reading of input Stop, Chi0, and Chargino Mass for the purposes of scanning over signal files
Added in some additional debug statements when "verbosity" is turned on

READMEs
updated with more current information

NewOviStopPlotSkimmer.C
Added in a bunch of generator information for Status 1 and Status 3 SM particles

StopPlotsSpectraShowNewDESY_wSyst.C
Added in saving string info for data-driven estimates and symmetric errors
Fixed 2D and 3D histogram grabbing for systematics (but haven't tested yet, as 2D and 3D hists w/ systs weren't available yet, condor queue has been slapped around recently)

Hadding shell scripts
Fixed some minor issues

plotHaddersStop.C
Added in appropriate stuff to match changes to StopPlotHaddInfo.h
