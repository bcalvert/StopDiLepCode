HistogramStyleFunctions.h

Added in a method to copy attributes from a TH1 into a TGraph (for example, after cloning TH1's points into a TGraph)

HistogramSystematics2.h

Added in some checks to handle when  "Up-shift" exists but not a "down-shift" or vice-versa, as well as when the given "systematic" is neither marked as an up-shift nor a down-shift; this needs some work, still, I think

For the "clonePoints" method, added in doing the "X" errors as half the bin width for each point

Same with the "fracGraph" method

StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h
Looking at the gen-level top reweighting, I chose to do the geometric means of the weights calculated with the two different pTs (Top and Anti-Top) instead of quadrature sum of said weights

StopPlotHaddInfo.h
Some fixes to some "bugs" for handling Oviedo

StopPlotsSpectraShowNewDESY_wSyst.C
Added in option for grabbing MT2ll systematic for all MC or just TTbar

StopPlotSetup.h
(See above) Added in option for grabbing MT2ll systematic for all MC or just TTbar
Fixed some style stuff for the plots
Error bars are drawn when central value isn't visible
Error bands for systematics on ratio plots are error bars now

NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C
genLevelTopRW is now the "central value" and the original "central value" is treated as a systematic (with switching the weights around)

plotHaddersStop.C
Fixed a minor bug in the parallel files handling (it would only manifest if different files from the same set of nTuples had different numbers of parallel files
